# Custom Goat Horns Minecraft Resourcepack
This work is licensed under CC0, please see LICENCE.txt for more information
This resourcepack changes the minecraft goat horns to have unique textures for each of their sounds.
I also attempted to match the horn shape with the sound
This pack requires either the (CIT Resewn mod)[https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-resewn] for Fabric (recommended) or Optifine.
Enjoy!
